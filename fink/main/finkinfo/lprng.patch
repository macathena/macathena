The following patch contains source code copied from the MIT Kerberos
distribution.  This source provides definitions of krb5_read_message
and krb5_write_message, functions which are used by LPRng's Kerberos
authentication code but which are private to the Kerberos library and
thus not available on MacOS X platforms.

This patch was written against LPRng 3.8.28, but since it is a single
hunk inserted near the top of the file it shouldn't be very difficult
to merge in by hand should it reject.

Hopefully in the future the LPRng authors will correct their own code
and stop using these private Kerberos functions.
