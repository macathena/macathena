Description: Athena's friendlier version of rm
DescDetail: <<
	The delete utility marks files and directories for later permanent 
	removal by prefixing them with '.#'.  Files accidentally marked for 
	deletion can be recovered with undelete.  Permanent removal can be 
	effected immediately with the purge and expunge commands.  The lsdel 
	utility lists the files that have been marked for deletion but not yet 
	removed.
