# MacAthena
## Welcome to MacAthena
 The MacAthena project is working to bring the functionality of the [Athena system](http://web.mit.edu/is/topics/athena/) to your [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, or Lion machine.

MacAthena is a project of [SIPB](http://sipb.mit.edu/). If you have questions or comments, please contact the [MacAthena maintainers.](mailto:sipb-macathena@mit.edu)

## Installing MacAthena
The instructions to install MacAthena are on a [separate page.](http://macathena.mit.edu/wiki/Install)

## Goals
Eventually, the MacAthena project would like to offer:

  * Full command-line compatibility with Linux Athena
  * Cocoa applications to provide easy-to-use interfaces to common Athena tasks
  * A package based system allowing MacAthena users to setup anything from a few utilities to a system with Kerberos-based logins and AFS home directories
  * Support in common lockers, providing MacAthena users with access to the wealth of software available in AFS 

## What We Have
At this point, we have the following major features:

### Available by installing macathena-basic

    /mit automounter - Access AFS lockers simply accessing paths of the form /mit/locker, eliminating the need to actually attach lockers.
    add
    Moira clients, including blanche, stella, and moira 

### Available by Installing macathena-standard
(Many of these commands are not frequently used, but some locker programs depend on their presence)

    athinfo
    delete
    discuss
    get-cluster
    just
    machtype 

## FAQ
Q: Package xyz that I really care about isn't in MacAthena! Why not?

A: Well, it's possible we just haven't tried to port it yet, or maybe we haven't gotten it to work. We keep a list of [packages we're having a hard time porting.](http://macathena.mit.edu/wiki/PackageBlocks)
