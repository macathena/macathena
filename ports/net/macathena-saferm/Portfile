description         	A safe alternative to rm for Athena
long_description        saferm is a file removal program which can be used running as root \
 to safely remove, and optionally zero, files or directories from \
 world-writable directories, such as /tmp.  It will refuse to \
 change directories through symbolic links, and it will not zero \
 files that have more than one hard link.
