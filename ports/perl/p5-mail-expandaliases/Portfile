description         Expand aliases from /etc/aliases files

long_description \
    I've looked for software to expand aliases from an alias file for \
    a while, but have never found anything adequate. In this day and \
    age, few public SMTP servers support EXPN, which makes alias \
    expansion problematic. This module, and the accompanying \
    expand-alias script, attempts to address that deficiency.
